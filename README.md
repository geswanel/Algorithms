# Algorithms

## Problem solving 
1. Analyzing problem
    - Understand description
    - Analyze restrictions => complexity
    - Solve example cases
2. Developing algorithm
    - Idea level
    - Prototyping
        - Natural-language
        - Flow charts
3. Coding solution
4. Testing and Debugging

Sometimes creating tests can be performed before coding and developing algorithm.

### How to improve?
#### Theory
- Fast and slow brains are involved to solve any kind of problems.
- Intuition is a part of fast brain that helps to get general idea very fast
- Insight is a part of slow brain that happens after deliberate work
- So for problem solving you have to develop your intuition and your slow brain to
justify and explain solutions through logic or maybe identify that your intuition is wrong.

#### How to improve?
- Gather knowledge for intuition
    1. Read a banch of hard problems and their solutions
    2. Identify components of problem and solution ideas
    3. Ask questions:
        - Why it's important?
        - How to come up with this idea or that idea - understand why this association works
    4. Make it easy t remember.
- Create a mental mapping for each problem (even when solving yourself)
    - Slow solving through logic
    - or Fast mapping through reading solutions.
- Slow solving strategy
    - Deepen understanding and improve logic
- Test your intuition
    - read problem
    - Come up with ideas
    - Check solution and check your ideas
        - If ideas wrong - understand why and solve it
- **DON'T NEGLECT SLOW PRACTICE -> IMPROVE YOUR LOGIC TOO**
